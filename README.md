# JS Number Guessing GameðŸ”¢

I have made a Number Guessing Game using HTML, CSS, and JS as a part of my JavaScript learning journey. This is my first major project which includes usage of JavaScript.

**Gameplay**:

- Enter Your Number in the text box
- Click on 'Check!' to check for your answer.
- If your answer is not the guessed number 1 point will be deducted from your score.
- If your number is smaller than the guessed number you will see, 'Too Low!' and if its bigger than you will see, 'Too High!'.
- Use this to guess the right number.
- When your number matches the guessed number Page color will turn to Green and your current score will treated as High Score.
- Click on 'Again!' to play again. Do not refresh the page it will restore your High Score to 0.

Have Fun!ðŸŽ‰
